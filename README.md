<h1>Flight Booking Project With Spring Boot</h1>

<p>In This Project I've Used <strong>Spring Boot</strong>, <strong>Spring Data JPA</strong>, <strong>Hibernate</strong>, <strong>Spring Security</strong> And <strong>ModelMapper</strong> To Create A Flight Booking App</p>

<p><strong><i>/flightBooking/login</i></strong> ====> User Has To Be Signed Up First. Response Is A JWT Token</p>
